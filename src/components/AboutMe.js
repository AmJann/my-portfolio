            I've went from self-learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to being enrolled in General Assembly in the Software Engineering Flex Immersive bootcamp. I graduated July 23rd 2022! I am an expert Googler and problem solver. My previous roles in traffic control and utility locating were jobs centered around problem solving, which has given me the upper edge in my journey into web development. Besides problem solving, having been a crew lead, I developed optimal communication, leadership, and team building skills.
