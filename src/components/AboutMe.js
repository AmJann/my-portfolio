          I successfully completed the Full-stack Software Engineering Immersive
          program at General Assembly, an intensive 24-week, 450+ hour
          curriculum, graduating in July 2022. Throughout my journey, I actively
          led and participated in various hackathon events. Notably, I led a
          team in a competition with over 1,500 participants, advancing to the
          fourth week out of five and securing a position among the top 80
          software engineers.
          <br />
          Presently, I am an apprentice at Underdog Developers, where I am
          fortunate to be mentored by some of the industry's finest
          professionals. Engaging in challenging one-on-one paired programming
          sessions with senior engineers from leading companies has been an
          invaluable aspect of my learning experience.
